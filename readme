Explanation of the Code
Sessions:
session_start(); — starts a session so you can store and retrieve user data.
Getting Information:
$_SERVER['REMOTE_ADDR'] — retrieves the user's IP address.
$_SERVER['HTTP_USER_AGENT'] — retrieves information about the browser and operating system.
$_SERVER['REQUEST_URI'] — retrieves the URL of the page being requested by the user.
date('Y-m-d H:i:s') — gets the current time.
Authorization Check:
If the user is logged in (e.g., their username is stored in the session), that information is added to the $userInfo array. If not, it sets the value to "Guest".
Output Information:
Uses HTML to format and display user information in a table.
